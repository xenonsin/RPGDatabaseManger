- Use 4 spaces (soft tab) for indentation;

- Private variables begin with lowercase and is in camelCase;

- Public properties start with uppercase and is in CamelCase;

- Functions start with uppercase and is in CamelCase;

- Functions should encompass a single task. Separate large blocks of code to make it more readable.

- Variable/function names should be descriptive (i.e. NOT  x,y,z  YES windowWidth, windowHeight)

- Comments are to be only used when the variable/function names don’t adequately describe what’s going on. Describe why not what or how.
